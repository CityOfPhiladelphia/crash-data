| Contents | This data set contains crash data for the years 2011-2013, aggregated to TAZ (Traffic Analysis Zone).  This aggregated data includes: Total Traffic Crashes, Total Traffic Fatalities, Total Major Injuries, Total Injuries, Total Bicyclists Involved in Crashes, Total Bicyclist Fatalities, Total Bicyclist Major Injuries, Total Pedestrian Involved in Crashes, Total Pedestrian Major Injuries, and Total Pedestrian Fatalities. The data is used to understand where crashes are in the City of Philadelphia so that we can focus our engineering, education, and enforcement efforts in the correct locations. This database summarizes crash reports from the Philadelphia Police Department, university police departments, state police, police from adjoining municipalities, transportation authorities, and other agencies with sworn police officers. Limitations to the information provided in this database are two-fold, the first being the definition of a “reportable motor vehicle crash". Because of this definition, any pedestrian or bicycle crash that did not result in an injury or a fatality is not reported in the PennDOT database; therefore, many minor crashes are not reported. In addition, the data also does not include crashes that did not involve a motor vehicle. It is important to note that omitted crashes could include crashes that resulted in serious injuries or fatalities and occurred on public streets. One final note on the limitations of a “reportable motor vehicle crash”, the Pennsylvania Vehicle Code definition of a motor vehicle specifically excludes vehicles that operate on rails, such as trolleys.  As a result, crashes between a trolley and a pedestrian or a bicyclist are not included in the PennDOT database even if they resulted in a severe injury or fatality.  The second limitation of the PennDOT database is that it aggregates crash reports, which are not always complete, to provide both descriptive (e.g. age, time of day, etc.) and geospatial (latitude and longitude) information for crashes.  Because of this, 3%-10% of bicycle and pedestrian descriptive crash information is missing from the database.  The quality of data has consistently improved in recent years and geospatial omissions were kept under 0.5% in the last two years. High crash hotspots found in this report reflect the concentration of pedestrian and bicycle crashes, regardless of the concentration of pedestrian or bicycle activity in an area or “exposure.” High concentrations of pedestrian and bicycle activity in an area can lead to higher concentrations of crashes. Without accurate information on pedestrian and bicycle volumes, determining relative danger of a roadway or intersection is not possible. It is also important to address the absolute number of crashes to improve the overall pedestrian and bicycle safety. |
